And we were nominated for an Emmy despite not having won.</p>

            <p class="project-description">For the Kardashians I was rarely in the field and performed a task one might call "writing" -- although they were amazing writers of their own material. I led a team of story editors tasked with assembling full episodes roughly to be honed by polishing editors. <span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: underline;">I did go to Montana with them</span>. While I can't say I still keep up, I remain a staunch Kardashians apologist and I'll happily dust off a diatribe about how they're unfairly derided.</p>

            <p class="project-description">This was a spin off of The Hills that took place in New York City. The show was made concurrently alongside The Hills, which marked one of the busiest moments of my career as I worked on both shows. While the characters overlapped, keeping the episodes from two different shows in one's head at the same time proved to be quite challenging.</p></div>

            <p class="project-description">On "The Hills" I began in the field and then progressed into the edit, first tracking the story in person--A rapacious note-taker--and then helping lay it out with editors, so it could track best for viewers. this is where my love of editing software. I also produced several clip shows for the hills and I produced the deleted scenes for the dvds for each season, in addition to producing a third of the episodes along with two other story producers.</p></div>

            <p class="project-description">This was a raucous show centering around a group of friends and acquaintances in West Virginia, with their own particularly "country" brand of partying and having fun. It was a redneck show before duck dynasty, but it ended in tragedy. One season after I left the show, the star died in a fluke accident. His truck became stuck in the mud and he fell asleep without realizing he was inhaling carbon monoxide.</p></div>

            <p class="project-description">This was a show that followed a group of four women, each of whom lived their lives wheelchair-bound. The push girls sought to overcome expectations and show people not only how to treat others with compassion but also how an everyday challenge might pale in comparison to the difficulties routinely overcome by the wheelchair community.</p></div>

            <p class="project-description">For "Decoded," I played a part in running the field crew, a job which took me from Florida to Alaska, and gave me a chance to sample the cuisine at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota (worst ever). For the Billy the Kid episode I had a strong director and a strong director of photography, but I was essentially in charge of the crew.</p></div>
