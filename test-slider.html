                        <p2>I have always known I wanted to be a storyteller.<br>I wrote some stuff as a kid. But when Joyce Carol Oates questioned the 'verisimilitude' of a sex scene I had written in front of my undergrad classmates, at a time when I probably wanted too much for them to persist in the belief that I knew what I was talking about, it had a dampening effect on my voice that lasted quite a while. Although this was perhaps for the good of all, since the world has enough hackneyed sex scenes without my contributing to the problem.</p2>

                        <p1>I was studying screenwriting at UCLA when I was hired on "The Hills." Matter of fact, I had just given two weeks notice at my job. I'd be leaving the Mondrian without a plan for what would be next. I just it was enough with working in Food & Beverage, I'd rather go jobless than continue another day at something I didn't care about. Promptly after that my car broke down. So I was riding an old bicycle to work for one of my last shifts, uphill in West Hollywood, when the call came through for the Hills job. That was a Thursday. I interviewed on Friday and started work on Monday. Over the next 5 years I got an education in reality TV production on one of the most popular shows of the time.</p1>

                        <p1>One of my favorite shows to work on was Brad Meltzer's Decoded, for History. We traveled all around the country, including to Alaska, and I was able to prove myself as an apt field general.</p1>

                        <p1>Sony was packaging formats for international markets. They hired me to travel to Brazil and assist a local production company there in the production of two separate pilots. One of them was sort of like a Brazilian version of "The Hills". The other was a medical show that used amateur actors to act out scenarios that could happen in a hospital. Can you guess which was more successful?</p1>

                        <p1>For a brief time I left reality TV to get a Master's degree at Otis College of Art & Design in Los Angeles. The school occupies an old IBM building by the airport, and has expanded in recent times, there along Sepulveda. It was a valuable exercise, a time period when I really got to hone my more erudite side as a storyteller. Normally if you drop "erudition" in Hollywood, they'll tell you to shove it.</p1>
                        <p1>For my thesis, I wrote a novel that peels back the curtain on the makings of the genre that had become my main niche, specifically the docu-soap variety of reality TV.</p1>

                        <p1>When I began on The Hills in 2005, it was far enough in the past that the show was still broadcast in SD, and only the editors had access to digitized footage; story producers had to look at it on VHS or DVD. I thought, "why can't we just look at this stuff on the computer?" It turns out this forward-thinking idea did not originate with me, because companies were already transitioning to a model where each story producer would have his or her own machine with access to all the footage.<br>It was that very first year when I began learning commands to control the Avid Media Composer interface. And on every job I ever worked, I would get my hands dirty on the Avid.<br> It was partly because reality TV is a bastard form that I was even allowed to do this. In a union set up, which we specifically were not, a youngun like myself wouldn't be allowed to lay hands on the footage unless I was a properly trained assistant editor. But this was something more like the wild west, and before too long, I could edit at a level that was at least as proficient as some of the editors I was tasked with directing. </p1>

                    <p1>I was hired for season 10, to lead a team of story editors assembling episodes.

                        <p1>Once I attended the Emmy's as a nominee. This was for my work on a show for YouTube. Two things were special about the experience for me. Number 1, I was called upon to help define and delineate how the show was to function. I really enjoyed this role. Secondly, it was the first time I worked on a show that was motivated to make a positive change for good in the world. I realized through this experience how crucial this would be in my feeling fulfilled.</p1>
                        <p1>That being said, I've worked on plenty of shows that were a delight to work on that didn't have this altruistic spirit. For example "Yoga Girls," which despite being ostensibly about yoga was not necessarily a therapeutic or healthful show. I loved working on it nonetheless.</p1>
