I was also a story producer, tasked with hunting down and choosing the best pieces of footage to use and build the story around. I directed voice over sessions and wrote voice over. The show itself centered around a bariatric surgeon in Houston who pioneered a way to treat folks who are super morbidly obese, individuals who many hospitals considered untreatable due to their weight. It was a show about food addiction, and the life and death struggle of individuals seeking to get help instead of succumbing to the urge to eat themselves to death. I worked on the show for five years and helped produce a total of 132 episodes, roughly 200 hours of TV. </p>

                  <p class="project-description">On this show, I led the editing team and did a lot of editing myself, the way I observed post producers doing at Bunim Murray. I was also a story producer, tasked with hunting down and choosing the best pieces of footage to use and build the story around. I also directed voice over sessions and wrote voice over. The show itself centered around a bariatric surgeon in Houston who pioneered a way to treat folks who were super morbidly obese, individuals who many hospitals considered untreatable due to their weight. At root, the show was about food addiction, and the life and death struggle of individuals seeking to get help instead of succumbing to the urge to eat themselves to death.

                <h2 class="project-title">Roman Atwood's Daydreams<br>(YouTube Red)</h2>
                <p class="project-description">This was a show in which a famous youtuber, Roman Atwood, sought to give away amazing life experiences to deserving individuals who had been nominated by friends and family. I was brought on after the show had begun production because they needed some help clarifying the story of the first couple episodes. So I was leading the team of editors as well as editing myself. It was a great show to work on because they had spared no expense with the camera department and there was a ton of footage to choose from. It was also great because it was a show that was making a difference in the world in a positive way. We were nominated for an Emmy.</p>

            <p class="project-description">On the Kardashians I ran a team of story editors and I helped figure out what storylines we were going to follow. I was hired for season 10, and by that point it was already a well-oiled machine. Also while I was there I helped create and produce three specials of additional content that looked back on some of the favorite footage of seasons past. I did get a chance to go into the field and meet the cast, even traveling with them on their family trip to Montana.</p>

            <p class="project-description">This was a spin off of The Hills that took place in New York City. The show was made concurrently alongside The Hills, which marked one of the busiest moments of my career as I worked on both shows. While the characters overlapped, keeping the episodes from two different shows in one's head at the same time proved to be quite challenging.</p></div>

            <p class="project-description">On "The Hills" I began in the field and then progressed into the edit, first tracking the story in person--A rapacious note-taker--and then helping lay it out with editors, so it could track best for viewers. this is where my love of editing software. I also produced several clip shows for the hills and I produced the deleted scenes for the dvds for each season, in addition to producing a third of the episodes along with two other story producers.</p></div>

            <p class="project-description">This was a raucous show centering around a group of friends and acquaintances in West Virginia, with their own particularly "country" brand of partying and having fun. It was a redneck show before duck dynasty, but it ended in tragedy. One season after I left the show, the star died in a fluke accident. His truck became stuck in the mud and he fell asleep without realizing he was inhaling carbon monoxide.</p></div>

            <p class="project-description">This was a show that followed a group of four women, each of whom lived their lives wheelchair-bound. The push girls sought to overcome expectations and show people not only how to treat others with compassion but also how an everyday challenge might pale in comparison to the difficulties routinely overcome by the wheelchair community.</p></div>

For the Billy the Kid episode I had a strong director and a strong director of photography, but I was essentially in charge of the crew.</p></div>
